  <h3>Welcome, interviewee person!</h3>

  <p>This is the Minted coding interview playground.</p>

  <p>Shake off the nerves!&mdash; nothing crazy in here.</p>

  <p>To get started, click the "preview" URL in the "app" tab below, which will open the running application in your browser. The page will automatically reload on changes. To view the test runner (useful for some exercises), open the "tests" tab.</p>

  <p>Coding exercises live in the <code>interview-playground/src/playgrounds</code> directory. Browse using the Projects Explorer to the left.</p>

  <p>If the development server dies for whatever reason, it can be re-started with the play button up top. Both the dev server and the tests can be re-started from the "Commands" explorer to the left.</p>

  <p>Have fun!</p>
