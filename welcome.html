  <h1>Welcome, interviewee person!</h1>

  <p>This is the Minted coding interview playground.</p>

  <p>Shake off the nerves!&mdash; nothing crazy in here.</p>

  <p>Our hope is that this project provides enough semi-realistic coding work to be able to explore your way of thinking about software and to work through some of it together.</p>

  <p>To get started, click the "preview" URL above the terminal below, which will open the running application in your browser. The page will automatically reload on changes.</p>

  <p>Coding exercises live in the <code>interview-playground/src/playgrounds</code> directory. Browse using the Projects Explorer to the left.</p>

  <p>If the development server and/or webpack watch process die for whatever reason, they can be re-started with the play button up top.</p>

  <p>Have fun!</p>
